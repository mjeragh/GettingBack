/*
 Custom sphere intersection function. The [[intersection]] keyword marks this as an intersection
 function. The [[bounding_box]] keyword means that this intersection function handles intersecting rays
 with bounding box primitives. To create sphere primitives, the sample creates bounding boxes that
 enclose the sphere primitives.
 
 The [[triangle_data]] and [[instancing]] keywords indicate that the intersector that calls this
 intersection function returns barycentric coordinates for triangle intersections and traverses
 an instance acceleration structure. These keywords must match between the intersection functions,
 intersection function table, intersector, and intersection result to ensure that Metal propagates
 data correctly between stages. Using fewer tags when possible may result in better performance,
 as Metal may need to store less data and pass less data between stages. For example, if you do not
 need barycentric coordinates, omitting [[triangle_data]] means Metal can avoid computing and storing
 them.
 
 The arguments to the intersection function contain information about the ray, primitive to be
 tested, and so on. The ray intersector provides this datas when it calls the intersection function.
 Metal provides other built-in arguments but this sample doesn't use them.
